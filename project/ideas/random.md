## Wakeup Slide

### When the user logs in or refreshes with a valid token, before being presented with the game screen, they would have a black screen that lists their last activity, location, combat, etc. This screen is like them waking up from a nap or sleep, and give the game time to get connected and set up before presenting the game screen.

## NPCs

### To tie in with the lore of the world, have npcs, controlled by the server, travel around. They could have specialties, and as they travel around, they will pop into their activities that they specialize in and give the player an assist.

## Local chat

### It would be cool to have a socket connection for each location, and maybe even facilities, at least the ones that make sense. We could display the facility/location player list, and allow players to chat in those sockets.
