## Basics

### World Name
Roznia

## World building

- A low fantasy, no magic world "collided" with a world of magic and monsters centuries ago
- Upon the initial collision, the world was swarmed with powerful monsters, but the people of the time rose up and fought them back. What is left of this collision are "mirrors", portals of varying sizes that are one-way portals from that other world.
- The initial collision infused this world with tons of magic - causing wild mutations of the natural world that we're still getting used to

## Gameplay binding
- It would be interesting to allow players to "find" valuable or interesting instances. Maybe you can be gathering and you find a mirror, related to the activity or not, that contains some desirable, rewarding content. Maybe a two-way mirror that contains a pocket dimension with valuable resources or an interesting or desirable setup of monsters to fight, with a boss or something.
