## Inspirations
- A mix of atelier and ffxiv
- The end goal is to begin crafting by selecting ingredients, which all have varying traits and qualities, and you use crafting abilities (that take time to perform) to process the items into something else.
- In addition to crafting abilities, a lot of items can be used as consumables to gain a buff, or influence the crafting process (e.g. sanding powder or something can be used to gain addition integrity during smithing)
- The craft starts with you having some amount of material integrity, which can be scaled by levels, attributes, and gear. You are trying to improve the quality and progress during the craft. You use up integrity during your actions, and the actions power or efficiency will scale off of your stats/equip/buffs, etc.
- Improving quality to certain breakpoints allows you to manipulate the qualities and traits of the final product, and each recipe has certain additional traits that the result gains by hitting them (so maybe you have some logs with crit chance quality, and some ingots with attack power, and you're trying to finish the item before the integrity is reduced to 0, while getting the quality as high as possible in order to lock in your traits and hit the threshold to get some quality bonus from the recipe)

## Implementation
- Maybe allow trial crafts so that players can get a sense for how it works without consuming items. You will just be wasting your time in order to gain experience and try things out. Maybe trial crafts only unlock after some time so players spend some part of their journey in that skill having their items poofed if they fail.

## Examples
- Smithing - smelting ores, there is a minimum requirement to begin crafting say bars from ores, but you can overload the inputs in order to be able to choose qualities or traits from the different inputs

## Goals
- The experience of crafting should be fun, engaging, have good feedback for your actions, and be worthwhile doing.
- All activities will have some small chance of having something crazy happening, so maybe while smithing you have some small chance, scaling off of some stat, to create a masterpiece item - the item you intended to create with some bonuses. Maybe we have some system to bind masterpieces to players, or maybe just let all gear be tradable.
