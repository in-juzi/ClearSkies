# Implement Housing

**Created**: 2025-11-09

## Description

Implement a housing system for ClearSkies that allows players to own and customize their own homes.

## Context

Housing systems are a common feature in medieval fantasy MMORPGs that provide:
- Player personalization and progression
- Storage expansion (additional inventory space)
- Crafting stations and utilities
- Social gathering spaces
- Potential revenue sink for the game economy

## Potential Features

- Purchase or rent houses in different locations
- Interior customization (furniture, decorations)
- Storage chests for extra inventory capacity
- Crafting stations (anvil, alchemy table, cooking hearth)
- Trophy displays for achievements
- Player visitors/social features
- Maintenance costs (rent, taxes)
- Upgradeable house tiers (small cottage → manor → estate)

## Notes

This would integrate with:
- Location system (houses as special facilities)
- Inventory system (furniture as items)
- Economy system (purchasing, maintenance)
- Crafting system (creating furniture)
