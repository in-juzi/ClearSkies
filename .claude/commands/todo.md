description: Save the last AI response as a todo task
---

Take my last response (the AI's most recent message before the user invoked this command) and save it as a new markdown file in the `project/tasks/todo/` directory.

Instructions:
1. Review the content of your last response
2. Generate a short, descriptive filename (kebab-case, e.g., "implement-combat-system.md")
3. Create the file in `project/tasks/todo/` with the following structure:
   - Title (# heading based on the main topic)
   - Date created
   - Description/overview from the response
   - Any action items or steps mentioned
   - Relevant context or notes
4. Confirm the file was created and show the filename

Make the content well-formatted and easy to reference later.
