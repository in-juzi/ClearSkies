## Your Task

   - Recent git commits and changes
   - Current file structure and organization
   - Database models and schemas
   - API endpoints and routes
   - Frontend components and services
   - Completed features vs. what's documented
   - Any new dependencies or technologies added

3. **Identify what needs updating**:
   - Add any new completed features not listed
   - Update API endpoints if new ones were added
   - Update database models if schemas changed
   - Update file structure if organization changed
   - Remove outdated information
   - Add new development guidelines if patterns emerged
   - Update "Next Steps / Ideas" section if appropriate

4. **Update CLAUDE.md** with:
   - Clear, accurate descriptions of current functionality
   - Up-to-date technical details
   - Current project structure
   - Latest API endpoints
   - Current database models
   - Accurate completed features list
   - Relevant development notes

5. **Maintain the existing structure** of CLAUDE.md unless changes are necessary for clarity

## Guidelines

- Be thorough but concise
- Focus on facts and current implementation, not speculation
- Preserve the existing tone and format
- Only add information that would be helpful for future development context
- Remove information that is outdated or no longer relevant
- Keep the file well-organized and easy to navigate

## Output

After updating, provide a brief summary of what was changed, added, or removed from CLAUDE.md.
