# Build Check Command

Check the Angular UI build for TypeScript errors and compilation issues.

## Instructions

1. Run the Angular build command: `cd ui && npm run build`
2. Analyze the output for:
   - TypeScript compilation errors
   - Template errors
   - Warning messages
   - Build success/failure status
3. If there are errors:
   - Identify the files and line numbers with issues
   - Categorize errors by type (TypeScript, template, module, etc.)
   - Provide a summary of what needs to be fixed
4. If the build succeeds:
   - Report success with build time and output size
   - Note any warnings that should be addressed
5. Do NOT make any code changes unless explicitly requested by the user
6. Present findings in a clear, organized format
